                            <li><strong>Introduction to TAH:</strong> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide. The Total Artificial Heart (TAH) was developed as a solution to replace failing biological hearts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Historical Development:</strong> The first artificial heart, called the Army Artificial Heart Pump, was developed in the 1960s by researchers at Harry Diamond Laboratories.</li>
                            <li><strong>TAH in the Market:</strong> Several artificial heart models exist today, including <em>Jarvik 7, Bivacor, CFTAH, SAH, SynCardia, Carmat, Polvad,</em> and <em>Abiocor</em>, each with unique designs and technologies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Future Plans:</strong> Research is ongoing to create a <em>cost-effective, durable, and biocompatible</em> artificial heart using advanced materials like <em>Titanium and Biomimetic Polymers</em>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Artificial hearts provide a <em>promising solution</em> for heart failure patients, but challenges remain in <em>long-term effectiveness and affordability</em>.</li>

                        <li><strong>Project Overview:</strong> This final-year project focused on designing and developing a low-cost transfemoral prosthesis, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics for amputees.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design & Fabrication:</strong> Following an extensive literature review, the prosthetic limb was designed using <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>. The components were 3D-printed and fabricated to create a fully functional mechanical prototype.</li>
                        <li><strong>User-Centric Approach:</strong> Special emphasis was placed on <em>comfort and psychological well-being</em>, allowing amputees to use the prosthesis confidently without embarrassment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Contribution:</strong> The project resulted in a peer-reviewed conference paper titled <em>"Design and Development of Low-Cost Transfemoral Prosthesis,"</em> which was presented at <strong>ICSTB-2021-BCSIR</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Startup Recognition:</strong> The project was selected as one of the <em>top 20 startups</em> in a national innovation competition, highlighting its potential for real-world application and commercialization.</li>

                        <li><strong>Project Overview:</strong> This project focused on simulating the effect of a stent within a blocked passageway to evaluate its impact on fluid flow, using both pre-treatment and post-treatment stages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design & Simulation:</strong> An idealized geometry was designed using <em>SOLIDWORKS</em>, followed by detailed simulations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with <em>ANSYS</em> to analyze the fluid dynamics with and without the stent in place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stent Overview:</strong> A stent is a small tube inserted into a blocked passageway to restore the flow of blood or other fluids. Stents are typically made of metal or plastic, while larger stents used for larger arteries are called stent grafts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Contribution:</strong> This project was part of an undergraduate assignment, aimed at providing insight into the role of stents in restoring fluid flow through blocked pathways.</li>
                        <li><strong>Files Provided:</strong> The parasolid and STL files of the design have been shared as requested, contributing to further study or adaptation.</li>
